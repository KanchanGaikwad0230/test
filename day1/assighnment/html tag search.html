        <h1>b tag</h1>
       <p> <b> The  HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use  for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the  element to indicate that text is of special importance.</b></p>
            <h1>i tag</h1>
            <p>The <i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others.

                <h1>u tag</h1>
                <p> <u> The HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</u></p>
                    <h1>select tag</h1>
